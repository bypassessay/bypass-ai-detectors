## **What Is the SafeAssign Originality Report?**  
SafeAssign is a **plagiarism detection tool** that checks submitted documents against various databases to identify similarities. It is primarily used within **Blackboard Learn** to help educators verify the originality of academic work.  

### **How It Works**  
Once a student submits an assignment, SafeAssign scans the document and compares it to:  
- A vast institutional database of previously submitted papers.  
- The **Global Reference Database**, which contains work voluntarily submitted by students.  
- Publicly available internet sources and academic publications.  

After scanning, it generates an **originality score** based on detected similarities. This percentage indicates how much of the content matches existing sources. The **SafeAssign Originality Report** then provides a **detailed breakdown** of flagged content for review.  

## **How SafeAssign Detects Plagiarism**  
To ensure accuracy, **SafeAssign** uses multiple comparison methods:  

### **1. Document Matching Process**  
SafeAssign breaks a document into small text segments and matches them against its database of academic papers, websites, and other sources.  

### **2. Sources Checked**  
- **Institutional Database** – Stores assignments submitted within the same school.  
- **Global Reference Database** – Contains papers voluntarily submitted by students worldwide.  
- **Public Internet** – Scans publicly accessible web content.  

### **3. Generating the Originality Report**  
SafeAssign assigns a **similarity score**, color-coded for easy interpretation. If the percentage is high, it means the document has significant overlaps with existing content.  

## **Steps to Access SafeAssign Report in Blackboard**  
If you’re submitting an assignment through Blackboard, here’s how to access your **SafeAssign Originality Report**:  

1. **Submit your assignment** via the SafeAssign-enabled submission portal in Blackboard.  
2. **Wait for the report** – It typically takes a few minutes but might take longer during high-traffic periods.  
3. **Go to your submission** and click on the **SafeAssign Originality Report** link.  
4. **Review your similarity score** and flagged content to understand what needs revision.  

By following these steps, you can easily check if your work contains any **plagiarism detection flags** before submission.
