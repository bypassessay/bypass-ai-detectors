# How To Check SafeAssign Before Submitting  

Academic integrity matters. Universities take plagiarism seriously, and tools like SafeAssign help ensure your work is original. But how do you check your assignment before submitting it?  

The quickest way is to use the SafeAssign Draft Submission feature in Blackboard. This lets you upload a draft, get a SafeAssign similarity report, and make improvements before turning in your final version.  

Running a SafeAssign self-check before submission has major benefits:  
- Avoid accidental plagiarism by catching unintentional similarities.  
- Improve originality by identifying sections that need rewording.  
- Ensure compliance with university standards before final submission.  

Let’s break down how SafeAssign works and the exact steps to check your work before submitting.

## 1. What is SafeAssign?  

### Definition and Purpose  

SafeAssign is a plagiarism detection tool built into Blackboard Learn. It scans student submissions against academic papers, web content, and other student works to check for similarities.  

Professors use it to verify originality, but students can also submit a draft to SafeAssign to review their work before the final submission.  

### How SafeAssign Works  

Here’s what happens when you upload a file to the SafeAssign plagiarism checker:  
1. It scans your document for similarities with its database.  
2. It compares your work to academic journals, web pages, and previously submitted assignments.  
3. It generates a SafeAssign similarity report highlighting matches and providing a similarity score.  

### SafeAssign vs. Other Plagiarism Tools  

| Feature            | SafeAssign | Turnitin | Grammarly Plagiarism Checker |

## 2. Steps to Check SafeAssign Before Submitting  

### Accessing SafeAssign in Blackboard  

To check SafeAssign plagiarism before submitting, follow these steps:  
1. Log in to Blackboard Learn.  
2. Open your course and find the assignment.  
3. Look for the SafeAssign option (usually in the assignment submission section).  

### Using the Draft Submission Feature  

Many universities allow students to run SafeAssign check before turning in their final work. If your professor has enabled this feature:  
1. Click on Draft Submission under the assignment.  
2. Upload your document.  
3. Wait for the SafeAssign originality report to generate (may take a few minutes).  

### Generating and Reviewing the Similarity Report  

Once the SafeAssign report before final submission is ready:  
1. Open the similarity report in Blackboard.  
2. View highlighted sections that match sources in SafeAssign’s database.  
3. Make necessary changes to lower high similarity scores.  

This helps you verify originality with SafeAssign before submitting your final draft.  


## 3. How to Interpret SafeAssign Results  

### Understanding the Similarity Score  

SafeAssign assigns a percentage score indicating how much of your paper matches other sources:  

| Score Range   | Meaning | Action Required? |  
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|  
| 0-15% | Low similarity, likely fine | No major issues |  
| 16-40% | Moderate similarity | Review content and rephrase if needed |  
| 41%+ | High similarity, possible plagiarism | Revise significantly before submission |  

### Analyzing the Matched Sources  

SafeAssign highlights copied content using SafeAssign in different colors, showing:  
- Exact matches with external sources.  
- Paraphrased content that still resembles another source closely.  
- Properly cited sources (which may still flag if not formatted correctly).  

### Fixing High Similarity Issues  

If your SafeAssign similarity score is too high:  
- Rephrase sentences instead of copying directly.  
- Cite sources properly to avoid unintentional plagiarism.  
- Remove unnecessary quotes and rely on original explanations.  


## 4. SafeAssign Limitations and Best Practices  

### What SafeAssign Can and Can’t Detect  

SafeAssign is great for detecting exact matches, but it has limitations:  
✅ Detects direct plagiarism from online sources and student papers.  
❌ Struggles with paraphrased content if reworded well.  
❌ Doesn’t check everything (closed databases, private files, some textbooks).  

### Best Practices for Using SafeAssign  

- Always run a SafeAssign self-check before submission if available.  
- Revise flagged sections by rewriting or citing properly.  
- Don’t rely 100% on SafeAssign—manual review is still necessary.  

### Avoiding False Positives  

SafeAssign may flag properly cited sources as matches. To prevent this:  
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes.  
- Follow correct citation styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).  
- Check if SafeAssign excludes bibliography and citations in its settings.
